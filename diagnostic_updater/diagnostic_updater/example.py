    #
    # The hardware ID should be able to identify the specific device you are

    # real-life example of how to make a DiagnosticTask by deriving from
    # DiagnosticTask.

    # Alternatively, a FunctionDiagnosticTask is a derived class from

    # a function. This will be useful when combining multiple diagnostic
