 *\brief Aggregator processes /diagnostics, republishes on /diagnostics_agg
 *
 * Aggregator is a node that subscribes to /diagnostics, processes it
 * and republishes aggregated data on /diagnostics_agg. The aggregator
 * creates a series of analyzers according to the specifications of its
 * private parameters. The aggregated diagnostics data is organized
 * in a tree structure. For example:
\verbatim
Input (status names):
  tilt_hokuyo_node: Frequency
  tilt_hokuyo_node: Connection
Output:
  /Robot
  /Robot/Sensors
  /Robot/Sensors/Tilt Hokuyo/Frequency
  /Robot/Sensors/Tilt Hokuyo/Connection
\endverbatim
 * The analyzer should always output a DiagnosticStatus with the name of the
 * prefix. Any other data output is up to the analyzer developer.
 *
 * Analyzer's are loaded by specifying the private parameters of the
 * aggregator.
\verbatim
base_path: My Robot
pub_rate: 1.0
other_as_errors: false
analyzers:
  sensors:
    type: GenericAnalyzer
    path: Tilt Hokuyo
    find_and_remove_prefix: tilt_hokuyo_node
  motors:
    type: PR2MotorsAnalyzer
  joints:
    type: PR2JointsAnalyzer
\endverbatim
 * Each analyzer is created according to the "type" parameter in its namespace.
 * Any other parameters in the namespace can by used to specify the analyzer. If
 * any analyzer is not properly specified, or returns false on initialization,
 * the aggregator will report the error and publish it in the aggregated output.
